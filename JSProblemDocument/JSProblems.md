# 1. Fizz Buzz

> FizzBuzz is the "Hello World" of technical interview questions. Your function should write the numbers from 1 to `n` with a twist; instead of any multiplier of 3, you output `Fizz`, instead of multiplers of 5 you output `Buzz`, and if they happen at the same time, you should use `FizzBuzz`. The output of your function should be a mixed array of numbers and strings.

## Sample Input/Output

> fizzbuzz(20);

### Output

> [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11,"Fizz", 13, 14, "FizzBuzz", 16, 17, "Fizz", 19, "Buzz"]
