# 1. Fizz Buzz

> FizzBuzz is the "Hello World" of technical interview questions. Your function should write the numbers from 1 to `n` with a twist; instead of any multiplier of 3, you output `Fizz`, instead of multiplers of 5 you output `Buzz`, and if they happen at the same time, you should use `FizzBuzz`. The output of your function should be a mixed array of numbers and strings.

## Sample Input/Output

### Input

> fizzbuzz(20);

### Output

> [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11,"Fizz", 13, 14, "FizzBuzz", 16, 17, "Fizz", 19, "Buzz"]

#### Difficulty: Medium
# 2. Prime Numbers

> Determine if a number is prime or not. Simple, eh? Be careful about the time limit.

## Sample Input/Output

### Input

> isPrime(13);

### Output

> true

#### Difficulty: Medium
# 3. Number to Text

> You receive a number between zero and one million (exclusive), and you should return the English version of it. No need to use and, but the output is case sensitive.

## Sample Input/Output

### Input

> numberToText(101081);

### Output

> "One Hundred One Thousand Eighty One"

#### Difficulty: Medium
# 4. Merge

> Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array. Please do not use the bult-in sort functions.

## Sample Input/Output

### Input

> [1, 3, 6], [2, 4, 8, 34, 67]

### Output

> [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]

#### Difficulty: Medium
# 5. Look and Say

> The look-and-say sequence is the sequence of numbers generated by describing each number to produce the next. The first few numbers are 1, 11, 21, 1211, and 111221. The next number in the sequence is 312211, because the last one has "Three 1s, two 2s, and one 1". Given n, produce the n-th number in the sequence. The output will not be longer than 20,000 characters.

## Sample Input/Output

### Input

> lookAndSay(7);

### Output

> "13112221"

#### Difficulty: Medium
# 6. Coins

> Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to change a given amount of money. For the purpose of this problem, the coin nominations are 1, 2, 5, 10, and 25 cents.

## Sample Input/Output

### Input

> changeCoins(8);

### Output

> 3

# 7. Database Shell

> We are going to implement a very simple string-based, key-value database, whose only interface is string commands. There are only two commands: SET and GET.
>
> SET <key> <value>: It sets the value of a record. key is a case-sensitive, alphanumeric (no spaces or special letters) string. value is the rest of the string after key and can include any characters, or even be an empty string. The output of this command is CREATED if that key did not exist in the database, UNCHANGED if the key existed but contained the same value, or UPDATED if it had a different value.
>
> GET <key>: This command returns the value stored in the database in the format of VALUE=<value>, or simply outputs NOT FOUND if the key does not exist.
>
> If an invalid key is used, or the command does not exist, the output should be ERROR. See the sample input/output below for an example.

## Sample Input/Output

### Input

> run([
  "invalid command",
  "set key1 val1",
  "SET key_1 val1",
  "SET key1 val1",
  "GET key1 extra_stuff",
  "SET key1 val2",
  "SET key1 val2",
  "GET key1",
  "GET key2",
  "SET key2 val1 val2_=_val3",
  "GET key2",
  "GET key1"
]);

### Output

> [
  "ERROR",
  "ERROR",
  "ERROR",
  "CREATED",
  "ERROR",
  "UPDATED",
  "UNCHANGED",
  "VALUE=val2",
  "NOT FOUND",
  "CREATED",
  "VALUE=val1 val2_=_val3",
  "VALUE=val2"
]
