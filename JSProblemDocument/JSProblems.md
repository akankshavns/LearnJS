# 1. Fizz Buzz

> FizzBuzz is the "Hello World" of technical interview questions. Your function should write the numbers from 1 to `n` with a twist; instead of any multiplier of 3, you output `Fizz`, instead of multiplers of 5 you output `Buzz`, and if they happen at the same time, you should use `FizzBuzz`. The output of your function should be a mixed array of numbers and strings.

## Sample Input/Output

### Input

**fizzbuzz(20);**

### Output

**[1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11,"Fizz", 13, 14, "FizzBuzz", 16, 17, "Fizz", 19, "Buzz"]**

# 2. Prime Numbers

> Determine if a number is prime or not. Simple, eh? Be careful about the time limit.
